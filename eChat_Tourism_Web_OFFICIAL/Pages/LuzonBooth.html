                        <p>Located south of the Pasig River and east of Manila Bay, the Walled City of Intramuros in Manila City was built by the Spaniards some 400 years ago as their political and military base in Asia. It is one of the top tourist spots
                            in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
                        </p>
                        <p>Apart from the 4.5-km. wall, from where the name came from (“within the walls”), other defensive structures used to surround the city, like moats, cannons, bulwarks, and javelins. Not only did it protect Intramuros from man-made
                            disasters, but it also fended off threats from Chinese pirates, Dutch forces, and other invaders.
                        </p>
                        <p>Despite being heavily influenced by Spanish architecture (think grandiose baroque church designs), renovations made also revealed its Chinese influences. Some structures, however, were not restored after the destruction of multiple
                            wars and remained today as ruins.

                            straight from the shell. The dish can be seasoned with chili, garlic, vinegar, salt, lemon juice, ground pepper, and mint leaves. It can also be cooked in omelets or used as a filling for pastries.</p>

                        <p>Sinaing na Tulingan is a Batangueno dish, whose name directly translates to braised fish, specifically mackerel and spikjack tuna. The process to make Sinaing na Tulingan is quite tedious, taking over several hours. It usually
                            involves simmering fish in large native earthenware pots with bilimbi/kamias, salt, and water. This brine helps remove the fishy flavor and helps preserve the fish over time.</p>

                        <p>Papaitan is a famous Ilocano dish whose name comes from the word pait or bitter. Comprised of goat and cow innards, papaitan’s distinct sour flavor and yellow color comes from the bile that is extracted from the animal’s liver.
                            While for the uninitiated, this may sound straight out of Fear Factor, the dish is balanced out with various spices and aromatics common in Philippine cuisine, such as ginger, garlic, and tamarind. </p>

                        <p> The name Luzon is thought to derive from lusong, a Tagalog word referring to a particular kind of large wooden mortar used in dehusking rice.
                        </p>
                        <p> Luzon is the main island of the Philippines and contains most of its active volcanoes. Volcanic activity is concentrated on the Luzon arc, which is associated with the eastward subduction of the South China Sea floor along the
                            Manila Trench. It is the largest and most important island of the Philippines.
                        </p>
                        <p> The Luzon islands include Luzon itself, Palawan, Mindoro, Marinduque, Masbate, Romblon, Catanduanes, Batanes, and Polillo.
                        </p>
                        <p> Luzon, which was coined after the Tagalog word kalusunan (which means northern part), is the country's largest island. Hence, it's expected to have the greatest population among the three island groups.
                        </p>

                        <p>“Marinduque’s Moriones Festival began in 1807 when Padre Dionsio Santiago, a Mogpog parish priest, organised a play based on the story of Longinus (or Longino), one of the Roman centurions assigned to execute Christ. A drop of
                            Christ’s blood miraculously restored sight in Longinus’ blind right eye during the crucifixion. Longinus instantly proclaimed his faith, whereupon he was chased around town, captured and summarily beheaded.</p>

                        <p>These days, a fabulous Easter festival combining folk mysticism with Catholic pageantry turns Marinduque’s streets into a colourful reenactment of those events, drawn out over the seven days of Holy Week. Each municipality in Marinduque
                            holds its own festival, in which hundreds of moriones don centurion masks and costumes and arm themselves with wooden swords, spears and shields.</p>

                            Christmas. Although the government allots a subsidy for each village, the locals also chip in to fund their unique creations. These giant lanterns can be costly to make as Pampanga’s parols can reach up to 20 feet in height.</p>

                        <h5 class="mt-3">Imbayah Festival</h5>

                        <h6 class="mt-3">Location: Banaue, Ifugao
                        </h6>
                        <h6 class="mt-3">Date of celebration: April 25-29</h6>


                        <p>The feast is focused on different areas and products of the entire province such as the making of wine, walling of stone, and planting of rice. The actual derivation of the Imbayah festival came from the local word “Bayah” which
                            refers to a rice wine whereas the word “Bumayah,” as well as “Imbuyah,” refers to the concept of having a bountiful harvest. Combining the two local terms paved the way to the birth of the festivity, the Imbayah. During ancient
                            times, this celebration was only limited to the elite members of the tribes. But now, this is freely open for all because it is also a way of sharing their tribes’ culture and tradition.

                        <h6 class="mt-3">Date of celebration: First Sunday of July</h6>


                        <p>The river festival is held every July, when a barge carrying a huge decorated float is released along the Bocaue River. This is where dozens and possibly hundreds of people partake on good food and great music. The floating feast
                            actually commemorates Wawa’s Holy Cross, which was first found floating on the Bocaue River.

                        <h6 class="mt-3">Location: Tuguegarao City
                        </h6>
                        <h6 class="mt-3">Date of celebration: August 10-17</h6>


                        <p>The country’s first-ever “fire” festival was born in 2014 after the city of Tuguegarao decided to celebrate the title as the hottest city in the Philippines. Pavvurulun and Afi are Ybanag words that mean “get-together” and “fire.”
