                        <p>The island got its name from the root word "langgam", which means bird in Bisaya. Viewed from above, the two ends of the island seem to flap like bird’s wings with the changing tides. With nothing but sun, sand, and surf, the 795-meter
                            sand bar in Palompon, Leyte is a picture-perfect destination with nothing to distract from its beauty.</p>

                        <p>Serene and tranquil, and boasting of fine white sand beaches, this island is a favorite holiday hangout, especially during the Lenten season. The historically rich Holy Week celebration of Bantayan Island is among the most elaborate
                            in the country—using life size statues during the Holy Thursday and Good Friday processions. Bantayanons also enjoy a rare Holy Week privilege of Catholic Church exemption from fasting from a 200-year old Papal Bull edict.</p>

                        <p>In Canapnapan, a barangay of Corella, you can see saucer-eyed tarsiers in the wild at the Philippine Tarsier Sanctuary. Over 100 of these territorial primates hang out in the immediate vicinity of the centre, though only eight
                            are in the viewing area. The guides will bring you right to them via a short jungle trail; no flash photography is permitted. The visitors centre includes good information boards and the whole forested sanctuary is well managed
                            and a pleasure to visit. </p>

                        <br>

                        <p>These cute furry creatures are considered as the smallest primate in the world. They weigh only about 113 to 142 grams or four to five ounces. Tarsiers are named such due to their special elongated tarsal bones, which form their
                            ankles and enable them to leap almost 10 feet from tree to tree. The most notable feature of the tarsier is their eyes, which are bigger than its entire brain. They hunt at night exclusively for animal prey which includes insects
                            such as cockroaches and crickets. </p>

                        <p>
                            The Chocolate Hills are a group of unusually shaped hills located in the middle of the island of Bohol in Philippines. This extraordinary landscape is unique to this small island. It is unknown how many chocolate hills there are. It is known that at the
                            bare minimum there are 1268 hills but some estimates put this number as high as 1776. The hills are not huge; the highest one barely reaches 120 meters in height. Even so, most hills are between 30 and 50 meters. The conical
                            Chocolate hills are scattered within a fifty square kilometer area. Mystery still surrounds how the Chocolate Hills were formed. One of the more popular local legends is that long ago, two giants fought for days, hurling earth
                            and stones at one another, until they fall exhausted, friends once more, into each other's arms. However, geologists have differing views about how these hills were formed. One plausible theory is that they are weathered formations
                            of a marine limestone lying on top of an impenetrable clay base. .

                        <p>While only 7km tall and at its bikini line 500m wide, tiny Boracay is the Philippines' top tourist draw, fueled by explosive growth and a tsunami of hype. The influx of visitors caused the Philippines government to temporarily
                            close Boracay to tourists for six months. This 'rehabilitation' period, was used to restore the island to its former glory and it has since reopened with a limit on the number of daily visitors. The centre of the action is
                            dreamy White Beach, a 4km, postcard-perfect stretch of sand lined from one end to the other with hotels, restaurants, bars and dive shops several blocks deep. The beach path is typically awash with visitors, including large
                            groups of package tourists. The ocean is full of romantic paraws (an outrigger sailboat) giving rides; colourful parasails fill the air. After perfect sunsets, live music breaks out, and fire dancers twirl their batons.</p>

                        <p>Bojo River Cruise in the town of Aloguinsan, Cebu exemplifies sustainable tourism and is a well-applauded tourism destination in the world. Just recently, the Bojo River Cruise in Aloguinsan has made it again in the TOP 100 Global
                            Sustainable Destinations for 3 consecutive years since 2016, Tourism Inspire Awards Winner in 2015 and ASEAN Tourism Award Community-based Category Winner in 2017. The river cruise is managed by the Bojo Aloguinsan Eco-tourism
                            Association (BAETAS) and the Local Government Unit of Aloguinsan simply shows that nature and people can coexist to protect each other. The 1.4 km Bojo River is facing the Tanon Strait, the biggest marine protected area in
                            the Philippines which highlights a mangrove tour with local guides telling you about the unique flora and fauna found in the area. </p>

                        <p>Today, there are two Sirao gardens. The first one is the original Sirao Flower Garden where you will see the lovely flower beds of different colors. The garden suffered damages from irresponsible and reckless tourism. The management
                            improved the gardens and had decided to add more attractions, hence the addition of the Sirao Pictorial Garden and Camping Site.
                            <br>
                            <br> Here, visitors can enjoy a resort-like accommodation since it has a swimming pool, fountains, and camping grounds. There are also kitschy decorations all over the garden, plus a few more Instagram-worthy spots like the
                            giant hand and a lover’s nest.</p>

                            <br> From the entrance you will have to walk uphill for about 1.5 kl to get to the first waterfall. Along the way, souvenir shops are selling accessories such as beaded necklaces, bracelets, and Kawasan print t-shirts.

                            <br> Kawasan has many waterfalls. The first one is the largest of the three, and is usually the most crowded. An uphill climb for fifteen minutes will take you the second falls, and another, and another. It’s a good idea to
                            bring in your own food, the resort’s restaurants are not cheap and prices are not marked.

                        <p>Binakol is a tasty chicken dish similar to tinolang manok, except that coconut milk and meat are used in this particular Bacolod dish. What makes this Visayan cuisine treat really tasty is the use of native chicken, which is known
                            to be more flavorful than the common poultry. Because native chickens are also tougher, binakol cooking takes several hours to make the meat tender and release all the flavors. </p>

                        <p>Visayan Islands, also called Visayas or Bisayas, island group, central Philippines. The Visayan group consists of seven large and several hundred smaller islands clustered around the Visayan, Samar, and Camotes seas. The seven
                            main islands are Bohol, Cebu, Leyte, Masbate, Negros, Panay, and Samar. These islands and their smaller neighbors make up the central group of the Philippine archipelago. High mountains characterize most of the Visayan Islands
                            with the exception of Samar and Masbate, which are exceedingly hilly. Panay has extensive eastern plains where sugarcane and rice are farmed. Negros has large western plains on which sugarcane is grown. Corn (maize), coconuts,
                            bananas, tobacco, abaca, and root crops also are widely grown, and fishing is also important in the Visayas.</p>

                        <br>

                        <p>The densely populated Visayan island group constitutes an ethnolinguistic region defined by the dominance of the three major Visayan languages: Cebuano (which is the mother tongue of about one-fifth of the Philippines’ population),
                            Hiligaynon, and Waray-Waray. Cebuano speakers live mainly on Cebu, Bohol, eastern Negros, and western Leyte. The Hiligaynon are concentrated on Panay, western Negros, and Masbate, while the Waray-Waray are found mainly on Samar
                            and eastern Leyte. The two major Visayan urban centres are Cebu City on Cebu and Iloilo City on Panay. </p>

                            Aklan. This involves smearing oneself with soot to darken the skin and dressing up in tribal finery. The start of the procession is signaled by drums and whistles, and later punctuated by shouts of “Hala Bira!”</p>

                        <p>This annual festival, which is similar to Brazil’s Rio Carnival, literally translates to “many faces,” and is celebrated every October in Bacolod. Because of the smiling faces of the mask, Bacolod City got the nickname of The City
                            of Smiles.
                            <br>
                            <br> The MassKara Festival can trace its roots back in the 1980s and was born out of a crisis. It was during the time when the province's main livelihood, sugar, was priced at an all-time low because of alternatives introduced
                            in the market.
                            <br>
                            <br> It was also the time when a tragic ferry accident happened, which carried mostly people from the province including those from prominent families of Bacolod. To lift the spirits of the locals and bring back the smiles
                            on their faces, the MassKara Festival was created. The smiling masks were a declaration of the people of Bacolod City that they will pull through and survive the challenges and tragedies that they are facing.</p>

                        <h6 class="mt-3">Where: Tacloban City, Leyte</h6>
                        <p>The Pintados festival of Tacloban City is a Filipino festival with its own unique flavor. This Pintados festival recalls Pre-Spanish history of the native Leytenos from wars, epics and folk religions. The most expected aspect of
                            the Pintados festival are the festive dancers, painted from head to toe with designs that look like armor to resemble the tattooed warriors of old. Kasadyaan festival, on the other hand, celebrates the cultural diversity of
                            the Leyte region of the Philippines.
                            <br>
                            <br> Kasadyaan is a Visayan tongue word meaning to make merriment jollily. Local legend and folklore are portrayed by each participating municipality in colorful dance and song. The Pintados-Kasadyaan Festival is backed by
                            a Pintados Foundation which was incorporated in 1986 for the Sr. Santo Nino fiesta.
                            <br>
                            <br> These merged festivals of Pintados and Kasadyaan portray the body paint techniques reminiscent of the ancient war tattoo patterns of the warriors. This feast was previously known as the Leyte Pintados-Kasadyaan Festival
                            or the ‘Festival of Festivals.’ Señor Santo Niño de Leyte is the patron saint of the Leyte islands who is also revered every June 29th.

                        <p>It all started when fishermen would go out fishing for means of livelihood and some for consumption. Every day would bring a good supply of marine catch to the whole town. But one season the town’s marine catch decreased tremendously
