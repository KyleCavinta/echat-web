                            Literally the ‘grandfather’ of all mountains, Mt. Apo is a volcano that has never blown its top and, at 2954m, is the highest peak in the Philippines. Most mornings it is clearly visible towering above Davao. However, by 8 am a mass of clouds resembling
                            a fluffy snake usually conceals the peak. Local tribes believe deities reside near the summit and worship it as a sacred mountain, but it’s the environmental stress caused by human traffic that makes permission to climb it
                            difficult to obtain. Coffee is grown on the mountain’s slopes, which sit at the same latitude as Ethiopia.

                                It was an avian explosion. Rey Malana, a former seaman, owned a 1.3 hectare patch of riverside peppercorn farm in Tacurong City. One morning in 1996, he spotted four egrets perched on a tree inside his property. The birds flew away later that day only
                                to return with a few more winged companions. The cycle repeated every morning over five years, with other species coming in. And right before Malana’s eyes, their numbers skyrocketed to 20,000. Before he knew it, his black
                                peppercorn farm could no longer function. The birds had taken over the farm. But Malana, a nature-lover, did not have any intention of shooing them away.

                                The Grand Mosque built in Cotabato City was built in an attempt to help develop the Muslim community in the Southern Philippines region of Mindanao. As somewhat of a homage to the regions Islamic roots, the second largest mosque in Southeast Asia known
                                as the Grand Mosque was built in Cotabato. This giant mosque, on Tamontaka Bubong Road, is the largest of its kind in the Philippines. This structure occupies an area of 5,000 square meters and is built on a 5-hectare plot
                                of land. The Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah Masjid, also known as the Grand Mosque or Golden Mosque also features gold-plated domes with minarets which are over 40 meters high.

                            <p>The Sultan of Brunei, to whom the Grand Mosque was named after personally funded the construction of the mosque. The Sultan had an interest in developing the emerging Muslim community in the Southern Philippines. Through the
                                efforts of former Congressman Didagen Dilangalen, the Sultans investment of Php300 million in the region took place. Interestingly the project, which was completed in 2011 was designed by Christian architect, Felino Palafox.
                                The mosque also houses many guards who hold the Christian faith, this reflects the harmonious relationship between the different faiths of the region hold.

                            peanuts, and usually shaped into either a rectangular tablet or a round cake. This candy is evidently derived or is a variety of the Spanish turrón. In the Philippines, turrones de mani is sold or prepared mostly as a traditional

                        <p>The festival’s unique name is attributed to a popular piece of colorful cloth woven by the local T’boli women (T’boli is a tribe in the region). The cloth is known as a T’nalak, and is made of abaca clothing. There are a number
                            of reasons why this was the choice clothing among so many options. T’nalak is woven by the women of the community, symbolizing their diversity and unified resilience. The actual process of weaving the T’nalak is a tedious one,
                            requiring a lot of patience, precision and effort. Which actually reminds the participants that is the only way to obtain quality.</p>

                        <h6 class="mt-3">Location: Cantilan, Surigao Del Sur
                        </h6>
                        <h6 class="mt-3">Date of celebration: August 14 </h6>
                        <p>It is about commemorating that portion of Cantilan’s history where early Christians had to defend themselves against the raids perpetrated by Islamized natives or muslims, then called by the Spaniards as Moors or Moros. It was
                            said that from 1768 to 1830, several attacks were launched by the Moros, prompting the Spanish government and the people of Cantilan to establish the Baluarte de San Miguel that served as a fortress. The people also defended
                            themselves by means of SIRONG or ESCRIMA.
                            <br>
                            <br> It has been said that during those days, some of the raiding Moros were driven out of the shore by the image of a woman which believers later claimed to be the Blessed Virgin Mary. The apparition of the Virgin Mary every
                            time Moro raiders would attack Cantilan had captivated the hearts of the Cantilangnons, and nurtured in them a deep devotion to the Christian faith.
                            <br>
                            <br> The festival, as a way of commemorating that colorful part of Cantilan’s history, features an ethnic mardi-gras parade and street dancing, culminating into a war dance, and where the marauders are depicted to have been
                            driven out by virtue of the intercession of the Blessed Mother.
